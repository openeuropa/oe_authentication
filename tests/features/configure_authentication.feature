Feature: Authentication
  As the site manager
  I need to be able to configure the settings

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administer authentication configuration" permission

  @DrupalLogin @BackupAuthConfigs
  Scenario: Configure Authentication settings
    When I am on "the Authentication configuration page"
    Then I should see "Authentication settings"
    # Check for the default config is there.
    And the "Application authentication protocol" field should contain "eulogin"
    And the "Application register path" field should contain "eim/external/register.cgi"
    And the "Application validation path" field should contain "TicketValidationService"
    And the "Application assurance levels" field should contain "TOP"
    And the "Application available ticket types" field should contain "SERVICE,PROXY"
    And the "Force two factor authentication" checkbox should not be checked

    # Change the configuration values.
    When I fill in "Application authentication protocol" with "something"
    And I fill in "Application register path" with "test/something"
    And I fill in "Application validation path" with "validation/path"
    And I fill in "Application assurance levels" with "assurance"
    And I fill in "Application available ticket types" with "ticket.test"
    And I check the box "Force two factor authentication"
    And I press "Save configuration"
    Then I should see the message "The configuration options have been saved."
    And the "Application authentication protocol" field should contain "something"
    And the "Application register path" field should contain "test/something"
    And the "Application validation path" field should contain "validation/path"
    And the "Application assurance levels" field should contain "assurance"
    And the "Application available ticket types" field should contain "ticket.test"
    And the "Force two factor authentication" checkbox should be checked

@api @casMockServer
Feature: Register through OE Authentication
  In order to be able to have new users
  As an anonymous user of the system
  I need to be able to go to the registration URL

  Scenario: Register
    Given the site is configured to make users blocked on creation
    And I am an anonymous user
    When I visit "the user registration page"
    # Redirected to the Ecas mockup server.
    Then I should see "Create an account"
    And I should see "This page is part of the EU login mock."

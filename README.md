## Requirements

This module requires the following modules:
- [Cas](https://www.drupal.org/project/cas)

## Installation

The recommended way of installing the OpenEuropa Authentication module is via [Composer][2].

```bash
composer require openeuropa/oe_authentication
```

### Enable the module

In order to enable the module in your project run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drush en oe_authentication
```

EU Login service parameters are already set by default when installing the module. Please refer to the EU Login documentation for the available options that can
be specified. You can see Project setup section on how to override these parameters.

## Configuration

EU Login service parameters are already set by default when installing the module. Please refer to the EU Login
documentation for the available options that can be specified. You can see Project setup section on how to override
these parameters.

### Settings overrides

In the Drupal `settings.php` you can override CAS parameters such as the ones below, corresponding to the
`cas.settings` and `oe_authentication.settings` configuration objects.

```php
$config['cas.settings']['server']['hostname'] = 'authentication';
// As of CAS 3.x the port type has to be integer!
$config['cas.settings']['server']['port'] = 7002;
$config['cas.settings']['server']['path'] = '/cas';
$config['oe_authentication.settings']['register_path'] = 'register';
$config['oe_authentication.settings']['validation_path'] = 'TicketValidationService';
```

By default, the development setup is configured via Task Runner to use the demo CAS server provided in the
`docker-compose.yml.dist`, i.e. `https://authentication:7002`.

If you want to test the module with the actual EU Login service, comment out all the lines above in your `settings.php`
and clear the cache.

### Account Handling & Auto Registration

The module enables the option that if a user attempts to login with an account that is not already
registered, the account will automatically be created.

See the [Cas module](https://www.drupal.org/project/cas) for more information.

### Forced Login

The module enables the Forced Login feature to force anonymous users to
authenticate via CAS when they hit all or some of the pages on your site.

See the [Cas module](https://www.drupal.org/project/cas) for more information.

### Proxy

You can configure the module to "Initialize this client as a proxy" which allows
authentication requests to 3rd party services (e.g. ePOETRY).

```php
$config['cas.settings']['proxy']['initialize'] = TRUE;
```

See the [Cas module](https://www.drupal.org/project/cas) for more information.

### Two-factor authentication
The module allows to configure if two-factor authentication (in short, 2FA) is required for users to log in.
It supports three modes:
* _Never_: 2FA is never required for any registered user account.
* _Always_: 2FA is always required for any registered user account. A 2FA authentication method will be enforced directly on EU Login.
* _Based on conditions_: 2FA is required only for registered user accounts that match one of the configured conditions. See below.

**Two-factor authentication conditions**

The conditions are validated after the user logged in via EU Login, and only if
the login was executed without using a 2FA authentication method.\
If at least one of the configured conditions evaluate successfully for the user account, the login
to the website will be rejected.\
A message will be shown to the user to log in again using a suitable method, together
with a link that will allow to choose only 2FA authentication methods on EU Login.

The system will allow to configure any condition plugin (`\Drupal\Core\Condition\ConditionInterface`) that requires a user account as context.\
The default condition available via Drupal core is the User Role condition (`\Drupal\user\Plugin\Condition\UserRole`).
This condition can be configured with the roles that are required to use 2FA authentication methods in order to log in into the website.

### SSL Verification Setting

The EU Login Authentication server must be accessed over HTTPS and the drupal site will verify the SSL/TLS certificate
of the server to be sure it is authentic.

For development, you can configure the module to disable this verification:
```php
$config['cas.settings']['server']['verify'] = '2';
```
_NOTE: DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!_

See the [Cas module](https://www.drupal.org/project/cas) for more information.

## Development

The OpenEuropa Authentication project contains all the necessary code and tools for an effective development process,
such as:

- All PHP development dependencies (Drupal core included) are required by [composer.json](composer.json)
- Project setup and installation can be easily handled thanks to the integration with the [Task Runner][3] project.
- All system requirements are containerized using [Docker Composer][4]
- A mock server for testing.

### Project setup

Download all required PHP code by running:

```bash
composer install
```

This will build a fully functional Drupal test site in the `./build` directory that can be used to develop and showcase
the module's functionality.

Before setting up and installing the site make sure to customize default configuration values by copying [runner.yml.dist](runner.yml.dist)
to `./runner.yml` and overriding relevant properties.

This command will also:

- This will symlink the module in the proper directory within the test site and perform token substitution in test configuration files such as `behat.yml.dist`.
- Setup Drush and Drupal's settings using values from `./runner.yml.dist`. This includes adding parameters for EULogin
- Setup PHPUnit and Behat configuration files using values from `./runner.yml.dist`

After a successful setup install the site by running:

```bash
./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

This will:

- Install the test site
- Enable the OpenEuropa Authentication module

### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively, you can build a development site using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) with the provided configuration.

Docker provides the necessary services and tools such as a web server and a database server to get the site running,
regardless of your local host configuration.

#### Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

#### Configuration

By default, Docker Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional `docker-compose.override.yml` file.
By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base configuration and it's provided by default.
The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new
services.
If a service is defined in both files, Docker Compose merges the configurations.

Find more information on Docker Compose extension mechanism on [the official Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/).

#### Usage

To start, run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's advised to not daemonize `docker-compose` so you can turn it off (`CTRL+C`) quickly when you're done working.
However, if you'd like to daemonize it, you have to add the flag `-d`:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose exec web composer install
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/run drupal:site-install
```

To be able to interact with the EULogin Mock Service container you need to add the internal container hostname to the hosts file in your _OS_.

```bash
echo "127.0.1.1       authentication" >> /etc/hosts
```

Using default configuration, the development site files should be available in the `build` directory and the development site should be available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/build](http://127.0.0.1:8080/build).

#### Running the tests

To run the grumphp checks:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/grumphp run
```

To run the phpunit tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the behat tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec web ./vendor/bin/behat
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Disable Drupal 8 caching

Manually disabling Drupal 8 caching is a laborious process that is well described [here][10].

Alternatively you can use the following Drupal Console commands to disable/enable Drupal 8 caching:

```bash
./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode dev  # Disable all caches.
./vendor/bin/drupal site:mode prod # Enable all caches.
```

Note: to fully disable Twig caching the following additional manual steps are required:

1. Open `./build/sites/default/services.yml`
2. Set `cache: false` in `twig.config:` property. E.g.:

```yaml
parameters:
  twig.config:
    cache: false
```

3. Rebuild Drupal cache: `./vendor/bin/drush cr`

This is due to the following [Drupal Console issue][11].
